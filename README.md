Hi! and welcome to my profile! ðŸ˜Š

I'm Federico (Fede for short), a physicist interested in all matters of open quantum systems and quantum devices.
I'm currently a post-doc researcher at the Universtiy of Oxford, working in the group of [Natalia Ares](https://www.natalia-ares.com). I'm also part of [Janet Ander's group](https://www.quantum-exeter.co.uk) at the University of Exeter.

Most of my recent software development is hosted on one of my group's repos.

If you are interested in / want to discuss / collaborate in some topic related to open quantum systems please feel free to reach out!
